# SnakeAI

A snake game implemented in C# using the console as output. Users have the option to play snake or let an AI play. The AI is implemnted using a really simple pathfinding algorithm i built from scratch. This was a test game to help me learn C# and data structures such as a Linked List and a 2-Dimensional Array. I am working on implementing a better version using a better pathfinding algorithm, windowed output and improving my code architecture.


## How to install files and play

1. Fork and pull the repository.

2. Navigate to the **SnakeAI.exe** file.
